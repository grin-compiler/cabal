description: {

With cbits archives and modpak files Cabal can support alternative GHC backends out of the box.

- Build and install extra (cbits) archive file for non-Haskell code (c, cxx, cmm, asm).
  GHC plugins can observe and process Haskell related code, while the 'cbits' archive supply the foreign code parts.

- Install extra module related (modpak) files when available.
  Modpak is an optional file, it is generated by GHC plugins (or other tools) for Haskell modules.
  The modpak file format is not set, it could be a zip file or other format.
  In modpak files GHC plugins can store additional data for Haskell modules.
